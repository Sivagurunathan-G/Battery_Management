# Battery_Management

**Abstract:**
Our proposed module focuses on monitoring the battery and simultaneously acknowledging the owner with the battery status. The main parameters associated with the electric battery are current, voltage, temperature, and State of Charge (SOC). The proposed module comprises several types of sensors to monitor each of the above parameters. The current flowing through the battery at the time of charging and discharging is measured using the ACS712 hall-effect current sensor. Similarly, the voltage of the battery is measured using a 0-25 Volts DC voltage sensor. Then, the LM35 temperature sensor measures the temperature of the battery. Finally, the SOC is measured using the coulomb counter module LTC2941. The Arduino DUE controls the whole module, an Arm-based microprocessor. The Wi-Fi module ESP8266 is used for communication between the module and the vehicle's owner. The information is sent to the AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud through the MQTT protocol, and it is displayed to the consumers through a website. The consumers are alerted through automated mail whenever required. In addition, we are planning to incorporate an automated cooling system for the battery, which comprises a relay, pump, and coolant tube. The coolant tube is spiraled around each battery pack. The consumer can also control the relay through the website.

**Architecture:**
The architecture of this electric vehicle battery management system is designed for comprehensive monitoring, control, and data communication to ensure optimal battery health. The system employs a layered architecture, encompassing the sensor layer, control layer, communication layer, cloud layer (AWS), and a user interface.In the sensor layer, crucial battery parameters are monitored using dedicated sensors. The DC voltage sensor provides insights into the battery's voltage, a critical factor for specific energy calculations. The ACS712 Hall-Effect DC sensor measures the output current, preventing overloading of the battery. The DHT22 temperature sensor continuously monitors the battery temperature, triggering the automatic cooling system when necessary. Additionally, the LTC2941 Coulomb Counter, located at the charging and load terminals, accurately measures the charge entering and leaving the battery during charging and discharging, enabling precise calculations of the battery's State of Charge.

The control layer is centered around the Arduino DUE microcontroller. It processes data from the sensors, controlling the automatic cooling system through a relay based on temperature readings from the DHT22 sensor. This layer ensures that the battery operates within optimal conditions, preventing overheating and overloading, thus extending its lifespan. The communication layer facilitates real-time data exchange between the system and the AWS Cloud. The Node MCU	 WIFI module enables seamless communication using the MQTT protocol. This layer is crucial for transmitting sensor data efficiently and securely to AWS, ensuring that the data is available for further processing and storage.

The cloud layer, hosted on AWS, serves as the backbone of data storage and processing. AWS provides a scalable and secure cloud platform for the system. The MQTT protocol is utilized for communication between the IOT system and AWS, ensuring lightweight and reliable data transmission. The cloud layer hosts a user-accessible website accessible via HTTP requests, allowing users to visualize real-time battery metrics. In summary, this architecture integrates sensors, a microcontroller, and cloud services to create a robust and scalable electric vehicle battery management system. The layered structure ensures efficient data flow, control, and user accessibility, contributing to effective battery monitoring, automated cooling, and prolonged battery life.

**Coding : **
The code is written in Arduino IDE. As said in the architecture, the arduino will have a code to collect telementry data from the sensor modules, which will be transmitted to the NodeMCU and the NodeMCU will have a code to connect with the AWS cloud platform using MQtt. Also, we are using ardunio Mega in proteus we have a separate code for the proteus simulation.
